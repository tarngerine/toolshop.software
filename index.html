      <h1>Toolshop</h1>
      <p>
        <img class="logo-inline" src="logo.svg" alt="Toolshop" /> is a software
        imagineering studio and my independent practice. I help technology
        companies prototype and incubate new ideas for computing &mdash;
        focusing on novel human-computer interaction, graphics, and creative
        tooling.
      </p>

      <h3>Prototyping is Design</h3>
      <p>
        My career started off in Industrial Design, where I learned how valuable
        making prototypes was to the product development process. Making
        functional models we could test with people gave everyone hands-on
        insight into an idea's strengths and weaknesses, far more than a sketch
        or 3d model could. I've carried this way of working from the hardware
        world to software, and it's now my favorite way to help my
        collaborators. In several instances, the prototypes I built became the
        foundation of the public release.
      </p>

      <h3>Constant Learning</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020, I felt lost. I was a successful Product Designer/Product
        Manager hybrid, yet I was more disillusioned than ever. I spent a year
        with a therapist rediscovering my values. My top value was "love of
        learning", but I was rarely satisfying that day-to-day. I had to make a
        big change, so I quit my job and started this practice, focusing on
        programming as my medium, rather than documents and mockups. 2 years
        later, I approach each collaboration with a beginner's mindset, diving
        deep into creative and technical research to learn for both my and my
        clients' sakes. The artifacts I create show what's possible while
        expanding their imagination.
      </p>

      <h3>Creative Subversion</h3>
      <p>
        As a former contributor to Big Tech, I'm intimately familiar with how
        technological optimism can be used to exploit, and how capital can
        distort and change what the entire industry thinks are critical
        problems. That's why I prioritize collaborators that work on
        under-researched problems and create tools for people to understand and
        control their use of technology.
      </p>

      <h3>Collaborations</h3>
      <p>
        Reach out to julius at tarng dot com to discuss a project! I always
        start with a short trial to test out how we work together. Pricing
        ranges from $200-$300 depending on funding and stage of company.
